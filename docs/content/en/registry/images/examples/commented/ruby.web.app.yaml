# The 'web' key defines a single web instance container running a single web server
# process (currently Nginx), behind which runs your application. It configures
# the web server, including what requests should be served directly
# (such as static files) and which should be passed to your application.
# DOCS: https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app/web.html
web:
    # 'upstream' specifies how the front server will connect to your application
    # (the process started by 'commands.start').
    # DOCS: https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app/web.html#upstream
    upstream:
        # Describes whether your application will listen on a Unix socket
        # ('unix') or a TCP socket ('tcp'). Default: 'tcp'.

    # The 'commands' key defines the command to launch the application.

    commands:
        # The 'start' key specifies the command to use to launch your application.
        # If the command specified by the 'start' key terminates it will
        # be restarted automatically.
        start: "unicorn -l $SOCKET -E production config.ru"
    # 'locations' allows you to control how the application container responds
    # to incoming requests at a very fine-grained level.
    # DOCS: https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app/web.html#locations
    locations:
        /:

            # location to the application. Can be 'true', 'false', or an absolute
            # URI path (as in PHP, when it is typically the front controller).
            passthru: true
            # How long to allow static assets from this location to be cached.
            expires: 1h

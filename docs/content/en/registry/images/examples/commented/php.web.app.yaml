# The 'web' key defines a single web instance container running a single web server
# process (currently Nginx), behind which runs your application. It configures
# the web server, including what requests should be served directly
# (such as static files) and which should be passed to your application.

    # 'locations' allows you to control how the application container responds
    # to incoming requests at a very fine-grained level.
